so this is my attempt to 'fork' something that someone else made and make it my own.

atla5 made this blog to keep track of what he's doing and document the learning process and rationality for the design. i think that this is a really good idea and because i have a lot more to learn, it will be a good idea to keep track. 

The only problem is, my spelling is horrendous and this text box doesn't have any spell check. so i am very sorry to anyone who chooses to read any of the documentation i ever make because there will be errors.
